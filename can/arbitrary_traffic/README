Arbitrary CAN Bus Traffic
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These captures are the transmission of some content (in this case, the
BSD license), over a CAN bus, at different speeds and in different
modes.

These captures are not capturing specific vehicle or industrial
protocols.  While these captures were being taken, the CAN bus was
effectively being used as a file-transfer mechanism.

Logic Analyzer Setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Saleae Logic16.  Channel 0 was hooked up
to a custom TI ISO1050 carrier board, operating passively.  The CAN
bus was externally terminated by the bus participants, and all ACKs
were handled by the participants.


Data
----

These capture are in Saleae's Logic Software binary format, due to
Sigrok not currently supporting the Logic16.
