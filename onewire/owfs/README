This directory contains waveforms generated with OWFS


Tools:

- Logic Analyzer: Tektronix TLA 613
- Sowtware:
  - Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin)
  - owfs 2.8p15
- 1-Wire master: home made from:
  - PL2303 (USB to UART)
  - DS2480B (UART to 1-Wire)


1-Wire MicroLan:

Two thermometers were attached to the bus (only the data line was connected,
power was not):
- DS28EA00 (1-Wire Digital Thermometer with Sequence Detect and PIO)
- DS18B20 (Programmable Resolution 1-Wire Digital Thermometer)

The server was started as:
$ owserver -d /dev/ttyUSB0


Three dumps were created:

1) "owdir.sr" (samplerate = 1MHz)
A request to list devices connected to the bus was performed:
$ owdir
/28.9BCFC8000000
/42.A8A603000000
/bus.0
/uncached
/settings
/system
/statistics
/structure
/simultaneous
/alarm

2) "DS18B20.sr" (samplerate = 1MHz)
A read temperathure request was performed for the specified device:
$ owread /28.9BCFC8000000/temperature
        25.5

2) "DS28EA00.sr" (samplerate = 1MHz)
A read temperathure request was performed for the specified device:
$ owread /42.A8A603000000/temperature
      26.875


Conversion from TXT to sigrok dumps:

The provided dumps were exported from Flextronix TLA 613 logic analizer as text
files. A simple Python script was used to convert this dumps first into a
binary file and then into a sigrok standard dump.


Decoding 1-Wire dumps

sigrok-cli -i owdir.sr -a onewire:owr=0
sigrok-cli -i DS18B20.sr -a onewire:owr=0
sigrok-cli -i DS28EA00.sr -a onewire:owr=0
